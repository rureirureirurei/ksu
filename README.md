# ksu

*ksu* is a functional language that supports first-class continuations.
Its syntax resembles Scheme.

## Usage

The `ksu` executable can be used in two modes:

### Interpreter Mode (Default)
```bash
ksu program.ksu
```
Runs the program directly by interpreting it. This is the default behavior.

### Compiler Mode
```bash
ksu --compile program.ksu -o output
```
Compiles the program to a native executable. The `-o` flag specifies the output filename.

### Interactive Mode
```bash
ksu
```
Starts an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) where you can enter expressions directly.

## Priorities and tasks

- **0** - Core part of the language. Must be implemented as fast as possible.
- **1** - Important functionality that is blocked by the missing core parts. Should be implemented. 
- **2** - Neat idea that can be implemented in a sensible time. 
- **3** - Neat idea that would take substantial amount of time. Most likely will never be implemented.

Things I still have to implement:
  - Reading

    - call/cc does not work? (2)
  - Compiler (0)
    - Types (?)

    - Validate AST: function arity, special forms valid usage, unbound variables and functions, closure info (0)
    - Closure Conversion: basically remove all free variables by adding env variable (0)
    - CPS transformation (1?)
  - Types (2)
    - Dynamic typing with runtime checks (2)
    - Optional static typing (3)
    - Type inference (3)

## In general

Program is a sequence of S-expressions. Each expression is either:
- **Atom**: number, string, symbol, or boolean
- **Compound**: `(expr expr ...)`

Compound is either special form, or function application.

Special forms:
- `(lambda (params...) body)` - function definition
- `(let ([var val]...) body)` - local bindings  
- `(if test then else)` - conditional
- `(define name value)` - top-level binding
- `(call/cc proc)` - first-class continuations

## Examples

Basic arithmetic and functions:
```scheme
(define x 10)
(define y 20)
(+ x y)  ; returns 30

(define square (lambda (n) (* n n)))
(square 5)  ; returns 25
```

Conditionals and recursion:
```scheme
(define factorial 
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0) 
        1 
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))

(factorial 5)  ; returns 120
```

First-class continuations:
```scheme
(+ 1 (call/cc (lambda (k) (+ 2 (k 3)))))  ; returns 4

(define saved-cont #f)
(define result
  (+ 1 (call/cc (lambda (k) 
                  (set! saved-cont k) ; (2) set!
                  10))))
; result is 11, but saved-cont can be called later
(saved-cont 99)  ; jumps back, returns 100
```

## Types

Main types (runtime representation):
- **Number**: integers and floats
- **Boolean**: `#t` and `#f`  
- **String**: `"hello world"`
- **Function**: `(lambda (x) ...)`
- **Continuation**: captured by `call/cc`

## Built-in Functions

### Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `+`, `*` - variadic, fold over all arguments
- `-`, `/` - variadic, fold left-to-right starting with first argument  
- `=` - variadic, returns true if all arguments are equal
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` - binary comparison operators


### Keywords

#### `call/cc`
First-class continuations. Captures the current continuation and passes it to the given procedure. Only lambda expr with with arity 1 can be passed to it.

#### `define`
Top-level binding for variables and functions. Only allowed at the top level.

**Forms:**
- `(define <id> <expr>)` - bind a value to an identifier
- `(define (<id> <arg0> <arg1> ... <argn>) <expr>)` - define a function (equivalent to `(define <id> (lambda (<arg0> <arg1> ... <argn>) <expr>))`)

**Limitations compared to racket:**
- No optional arguments or variable arguments (rest parameters)
- No multiple sequential expressions in the body
- No forward-referencing other defines
- No nested function definitions like `(define ((<name> <arg0>) <arg1>) <expr>)`
- Recursion is allowed (currently only in lambdas)

#### `lambda`
Function definition. Creates a procedure with the given parameters and body. Can have multiple arguments.

#### `let`
Local bindings. Creates a new scope with bound variables. Can have multiple non-recursive definitions.

#### `if`
Conditional expression. Evaluates the test and returns either the then or else expression in the lazy manner.

### `quotes and pairs`

Quotes are not implemented. Cons are, though.
List operations: `car`, `cdr`, `cons` and `null` primitive value are supported.
At the moment, quotes are evaluated as list of exressions (the same as in proper quotes assuming that all values are primitives), and, 
are rather syntactic sugar to cons, than separate mechanism of preserving thing as unevaluated symbols.


### `I/O: `display`, `newline` (2)`
Type predicates: `number?`, `boolean?`, `string?`, `procedure?`, `continuation?`, `null?`, `cons?`
